This course project is for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

#1 To download the dataset to the set working directory
#2 To load the activity and feature info
#3 To load the training and test datasets and only keep those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
#4 To load the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merge those columns with the dataset
#5 To merge the two datasets
#6 To convert the activity and subject columns into factors
#7 To create a tidy dataset that consists of the "mean value" of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
#8 The result at the end is shown in the file tidy.txt.
