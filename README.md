This course project is for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:<br>

1. To download the dataset to the set working directory <br>
2. To load the activity and feature info <br>
3. To load the training and test datasets and only keep those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation<br>
4. To load the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merge those columns with the dataset <br>
5. To merge the two datasets <br>
6. To convert the activity and subject columns into factors<br>
7. To create a tidy dataset that consists of the "mean value" of each variable for each subject and activity pair<br>
8. The result at the end is shown in the file tidy.txt
